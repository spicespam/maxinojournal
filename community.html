                <i>Role: Working Committee</i>

                <br><br>The Donation Drive for Bata ng Calabnugan was held on December 3, 2024 from 3:00 PM onwards, at Calabnugan, Sibulan. The Bata ng Calabnugan, Inc NGO was founded in 2005, the aim of the organization being to provide a safe environment for at-risk and orphaned girls in Sibulan and surrounding areas in the region. The organization works in collaboration with Isla ng Bata, a non-profit organization which was established in 2004 in Rome to raise funds for the home’s operations. At the drive, we visited the orphanage to give the donations we had collected (having donated myself as well), after which we were given a tour of the orphanage and its facilities.
                
                <br><br>When I attended the event, I was touched by the care the workers of the orphanage showed towards their cause, and how hard they worked to sustain it. I was joined by my peers, and I found myself inspired by the level of dedication and attention that goes into the care of these children. I was immensely happy to be of help to the cause, knowing that my donation was going into the betterment and care of the girls in the orphanage.
                
                <br><br>This event made me wish to involve myself in more similar events and activities, as I’ve realized that doing so is a truly inspiring and fulfilling experience. Just the act of staying aware and spreading awareness itself can mean so much and make a big difference for these types of organizations. Out of everything that happened, I truly found myself impacted by the care of everyone involved, from my peers to the workers of the organization itself.
                
                <br><br>Because of this activity, I am more aware of the amount of dedication it takes to support and become involved with the community, and how fulfilling it is to do so.

                <i>Role: Working Committee</i>

                <br><br>The YACC Purok 6 Feeding Program was held on November 16, 2024 from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM by the Youth Annual Conference for Christ, to commemorate the celebration of World Children’s Day. This event was based in Barangay Ajong, Sibulan. The program was held to provide local children with the nutritious meals necessary for their growth, and I had joined this program as a member of the food committee, which made me and my co-members responsible for preparing the meals to distribute.

                <br><br>Upon attending this program, I had no real expectations for what was going to happen since I seldom attend events like this. I thought I would be in-and-out, delivering the food, ensuring it got to the recipients. Although I did do my job of delivering and preparing the food for the recipients of this program, as expected, what I had not anticipated was to be directly faced with the struggles of people in our locality, especially upon seeing how impactful a meal could be to someone. I was surrounded by my co-members, who had a clear understanding and passion of the importance of this act of service, and I soon found myself learning and being inspired by this as well.
                
                <br><br>This program made me realize that it is important to give back to the community, even if it is through small acts, even just as simple as a meal. These things can make an impact on people’s lives and ease their struggles, even for just a while. I have been made aware of my own privileges, and how to use them to help others. Due to this event, I’ve also been able to feel a deeper sense of unity, both with my co-members and with the community as a whole. If I were to do this activity again, I would go in with a more understanding and less clinical mindset, since I have realized that the program is more about the food you give.
                
                <br><br>Because of this activity, I am more involved with our community and I know the importance of giving back to it.

                <i>Role: Working Committee</i>

                <br><br>The SU Christmas Outreach, or the PEP Christmas Outreach, was held on November 27, 2024, from 4:00 to 5:30 PM, organized by the PEP Advisers and involving everyone who was enrolled in the PEP subject this semester. The program was held at the Silliman Church, with students, advisers, and the SU Janitorial Service members in attendance. As someone who, along with my peers, had donated goods to the janitors and handed them out during the service, my role was a working committee member.

                <br><br>One thing that surprised me was how many staff members were present at the service. There were far more than I had ever expected, which led me to realize all the hard work that goes into maintaining our school campus and keeping it clean. As I listened to the words of gratitude and thanks towards the workers, I considered how much I take for granted the services of these people, who work a job that most won’t even get to see them doing. In the middle of the service, we were cued in to go fetch the goods and hand them out to the janitorial staff, and one sentence truly stuck with me. The speaker had told the staff to let us work for them for once, which was a touching sentiment, as I realized that it is such a rare occurrence that the hard labor of the staff is acknowledged in everyday life.
                
                <br><br>This experience has made me realize that there is a lot of work that goes into ensuring our lives are made easier, at the cost of the tireless labor of others. To say I was inspired would be an understatement, as during this event I truly was appreciative of everything the staff does for us students. Handing out the bags of goods to the janitorial members formed a brief connection between them and the students. The event was the epitome of giving back to the community, and I hope the next time I involve myself in something else like this, I am able to perform at my best.
                
                <br><br>Because of this activity, I am aware of the hard work that goes into making our lives easier, and I want to give back to those who do so for us.

                <i>Role: Working Committee</i>
                <br><br>The LTS Christmas Outreach was held on December 7, 2024, from 1:00 to 5:00 PM, for the Little Children of the Philippines (LCP) from Daro. The event itself is an annual activity, being held for children who had come from abusive home lives or children who had been orphaned. The outreach took place at the Cimafranca Ball Field, and as someone who had prepared the gifts for the children, planned out games to play during the event, ensured that the venue was prepared by setting up the tables and chairs, and watched over the activities of the event and the children, my role in the event was a working committee member.

                <br><br>I was quite nervous for this event since in all honesty, I am not the best at dealing with children and I had minor experience prior to this event. I was also worried about the rest of my LTS classmates’ reactions to the children, since not everyone is equipped with the knowledge on how to properly handle children. However, the event turned out to go better than I had expected, with everyone enjoying the games we had prepared, and with all the planned activities going through, even despite the unexpected bout of rain that occurred. In addition, as a videographer for my team, I also had the opportunity to accompany the children to the ROTC Museum of Silliman. The experience as a whole felt extremely rewarding, seeing how the children from LCP were enjoying themselves as a result of our efforts.
                
                <br><br>This event provided me with the opportunity to help out the community, which is something that is quite rare to come upon in our area. It was nice to be there, hands-on, seeing the happiness that our efforts had resulted in, which made me truly see how using your compassion and care for a cause can help immensely. The event was majorly and wholly beneficial, and I believe that such events should happen much more than they do. I believe that it is vital to help where one can, as a harmonious and fair world is one that everyone wants. As they say, small acts of kindness can go a long way.
                
                <br><br>Because of this activity, I am aware of the value of compassion and helping others, and I wish to seek out more opportunities to do so in the future.

                <i>Role: Working Committee</i>
                <br><br>The event Caring For Creation: Contributing to the Fisheries and Biodiversity Enhancement of Dumaguete
                Coast was held on November 23, 2024 from 2:00 to 4:00 PM. I took part in this event as a working member,
                a representative of the Overseas Student Fellowship (OSF). My job was to work with the organizers, the
                Silliman University Church Board of Elders, upon the event’s occurrence by preparing the venue and the
                snacks for the event. For this event, I had donated 200 pesos in the name of restoring and
                rehabilitating coral reefs and marine habitats that had been degraded (the certificates, unfortunately,
                have not been released yet).

                <br><br>Dr. Aileen Maypa spoke to us during this event to explain what had been going on in
                the marine life surrounding our shores, and provided us with an initiative to rehabilitate the damaged
                state of these coral reefs. She made sure all of us present at the briefing understood the purpose of
                this rehabilitation of marine habitats, and the importance of conserving marine life. Her words had
                left a lasting impression on me, since it is quite rare to find and interact with someone in real life
                with a great interest and passion for such subjects.

                <br><br>This event solidified my interest and belief in the importance of conserving the natural world, and Dr.
                Maypa’s briefing had provided me with much to think about. Her desire to preserve marine life was
                inspiring in that she was persistent and evidently had persevered through much struggle, particularly in
                her attempts to preserve the coasts of Dumaguete City. This has inspired me to remain resilient and
                always support the causes I believe in, especially when it comes to often overlooked yet important
                issues in our society.

                <br><br>Because of this activity, I am more proactive in my beliefs and I understand how crucial it is to take
                care of the natural world around me.
