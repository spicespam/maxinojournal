                <i>Role: Participant</i>

                <br><br>On August 22, 2024 from 8:00 to 11:00 AM, Miller Solutions Development Inc. held an Industry Lecture at ATA
                Hall, entitled “Designing Intuitive User Experience: Key UI/UX Strategies”. The speakers of this lecture
                were alumni from Silliman who now worked at Miller, Sheen Glaize Balatero and Trisha Dominyk Alvarez,
                their specialty of course being in UI and UX. Aside from that, I was joined by the majority of the CCS
                freshmen who were invited to this event to hear the experiences of CCS graduates.

                <br><br>Going into this lecture, I didn’t actually know what to expect. I had an idea of what UX and UI
                was, but
                I didn’t know what to expect in terms of the actual content of the lecture. The lecturers were actually
                very knowledgeable about their subject and were able to relay this information to us in a relatable and
                understandable way. Like a lot of the events in the first week of school, I assumed it would be an
                uptight atmosphere, but it was actually a rather social experience. At the end of the program, we were
                tasked to create a UI for a navigator app to enter in a contest, which we were to do with a group or a
                partner.

                <br><br>I feel this event taught me what to expect in the future, what challenges may be present when I
                am
                applying my skills and knowledge, as well as provided me with some advice on overcoming these challenges
                and obstacles. It inspired me to look at user interface in a more practical light, which I think should
                help me in my future endeavors when I need to utilize my skills professionally.

                <br><br>Because of this activity, I am a more knowledgeable student of my college, and I have more
                confidence in
                applying my skills.

                <i>Role: Participant</i>

                <br><br>The Balik Talent Lecture: Big Data and IoT: Why They Matter in Innovation was held on August 20,
                2024 from 8:00 to 11:00 AM, the
                speaker now working in a foreign country after graduating from Silliman
                University’s College of Computer Studies. As part of the CCS Founder’s Week activities, the freshmen of
                the college were invited to join and learn the importance of the subject matter.

                <br><br>The speaker was lecturing about Big Data and the Internet of Things, which many of us in the
                audience
                barely had a grasp on due to our lack of knowledge on the subject and our year level as freshmen.
                However, the speaker conveyed his points clearly, so I still left the classroom knowing more than I did
                before. I was suddenly aware of the complexities of technology, and how deep the iceberg goes when it
                comes to the development of even just simple automated software. Though, this didn’t discourage me
                whatsoever.

                <br><br>I wanted to learn more about the topics he spoke on. Because of this, the open forum was the
                most
                interesting part for me. It was also quite inspiring to learn how he managed to land a good job in a
                foreign country, even when he was tasked to make something he had never made before in order to apply,
                which was an Android app. The speaker’s story relayed a message I always made sure (and will always
                continue) to remember whenever I do anything, which is that it is always worth it to try no matter how
                bad you may think you are at something. It is the only way to learn.

                <br><br>Because of this activity, I am more hopeful in my future and I remain inspired to do the best I
                can,
                both in my fields of expertise and in skills I have yet to learn.

                <i>Role: Participant</i>
                <br><br>The Campus Tour was held on September 18, 2024 at 1:00 PM and was an activity us freshmen had to
                participate in. It was led by the Campus Ambassadors and was organized in fulfillment of our GE10-A
                subject. The full-length tour was meant to acquaint students with the layout and history of Silliman
                Campus, as well as to help us make a project for the aforementioned subject that involved creating an
                informational video about the campus.

                <br><br>I learned a lot of things during this tour that I previously had never heard of. Although I am
                very
                familiar with the Silliman Campus, having literally lived in it during my childhood when my grandparents
                were still working in SU (Mango Cottage - Atillo Residence), I didn’t know much about the actual history
                behind many of the buildings. For example, although I knew that the Campus was seized by outside forces
                during wartime, I wasn’t aware that the gym used to be an airplane hangar. I also was not aware of the
                exact count of acacia trees in the campus.

                <br><br>My worldview has become more open due to this activity, and I have become more curious and more
                eager to
                look for the history in everything I see, especially within the campus. I have always enjoyed learning
                about the past, but I previously never thought much about the areas around me that actually turned out
                to have a rich history. After the tour, I often go out of my way to find out more about a particular
                area if any information is available.

                <br><br>Because of this activity, I am more presently aware of the happenings of the world around me,
                both in
                the past and present.

            <p class="entrytext"><i>Role: Working Committee</i>
                <br><br>The Freshie Orientation was held on September 18, 2024, starting at 8:30 AM, and as the name suggests, all
                freshmen were made to join in order to learn more about Silliman University, the College of Computer
                Studies, rules and regulations of the department/university, faculty and staff, and more. To accommodate
                all the students, the event was held in ATA Hall.

                <br><br>I joined this event as a working member of the Technicals committee, which meant that I had to
                help in
                setting up and controlling the tech aspects of the orientation. I was joined by two of my committee
                members, as well as the committee heads who briefed us on our responsibilities before they took the
                backseat. Setup included downloading the necessary materials for the event, such as prayer videos, the
                Philippine national anthem, the PowerPoint presentation, and the intermission numbers, as well as
                controlling the slides on the projector, and ensuring all the videos played during the event. Everything
                went as planned, if not with minor hiccups that had to be smoothly dealt with in the moment.

                <br><br>As this was my first time actively participating in a job like this, it was slightly stressful,
                which
                minimized as time went on and I got used to it. I learned that during events like these, when working to
                make sure everything goes smoothly, one must always be ready to reroute a plan if any obstacles arise,
                and that even with a plan present, teamwork is essential to ensuring the best outcome. I learned that
                you have to make choices quickly sometimes, and that such a skill needs to be trained, but is not nearly
                as hard as most might think.

                <br><br>Because of this activity, I am less nervous about working in teams as well as in making
                calculated quick
                decisions under a time limit.

                <br><br>The University Orientation was held on September 11, 2024 at the Luce Auditorium from 9:00 to 11:00 AM, as a
                way to inform students about the various intricacies of Silliman University. This included the available
                services of Silliman University, its rules and regulations, as well as a general overview of the
                University itself. Many of the freshmen were there since we were all invited to attend the event.

                <br><br>I was in the audience of this orientation, and I listened as the speakers briefed us on the many
                things
                one can do in Silliman. Although I’ve been in Silliman for all my life, it was nice to have a refresher
                as well as updates on new undertakings of the university, such as the progress on the refurbished
                library building and an extensive overview of the university’s rules and systems. In addition, I simply
                enjoyed being in the auditorium due to its immersive environment, which made me feel much more
                attentive.

                <br><br>This event made me more aware of the things that go on in our school, as well as made me more
                sure of
                myself when it comes to the information surrounding the university. There were many topics covered
                during the short span of the event, which was appreciated by me since I wanted to know all there is to
                know about the university.

                <br><br>Because of this activity, I am a more aware and well-informed student of Silliman.

                <br><br>The Accenture Academy Technology event was held from 1:00 to 4:30 PM on November 19, 2024,
                being a full-day event albeit with another focus in the morning of the aforementioned date. I joined
                this event as a member of Technicals, being one of two people there in the committee. The event was held
                at the Audio Visual Theater and focused mainly on Accenture’s job offers towards students in the field
                of technology, and many seniors were in attendance due to the nature of this event.

                <br><br>I expected this event to be a little less stressful than it actually was. I was with only one other
                person at the AVT, and we were both working technicals. A lot of things had to be done last-minute, such
                as setting up the music and downloading the required files that needed to be played during the event. It
                was my job to stay in the backstage tech room, ensuring my laptop stayed alive and was playing all the
                necessary files in the background. My partner did the work ensuring technical difficulties were handled.
                In the middle of the event, we managed to rest for a while since there was nothing to play, but the
                start and end was the most eventful.

                <br><br>The event enlightened me on how tough backstage jobs can be, since it is our job to make sure everything
                goes smoothly and goes right. If any hiccup happens, there is no one to blame but the ones handling the
                strings of a particular event. Since there were so many people in attendance, not to mention an entire
                company hosting the event, I was under a bit of pressure. But in the end, everything worked out, and I
                learned that keeping a cool head is the key to success in these types of things.

                <br><br>Because of this activity, I am able to keep a cooler head during pressuring situations and I know what
                to expect the next time this happens.
