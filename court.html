                <i>Role: Assistant Organizer (Committee Head)</i>

                <br><br>The Mobile Legends Tournament 2024, hosted on October 22, 2024 (and throughout each passing
                Sunday) in Bacong at the Soludpan Gymnasium as a part of the Fiesta sa Soludpan 2024 events. The event
                hosted multiple teams of players from the barangay who competed in the tournament and was joined by the
                community.

                <br><br>Being an organizer of registration, I had to map out the details concerning the information of
                each
                player in the tournament. I had to ensure all the necessary information was collected, including the
                information of participants themselves, the team names, and more. I had to ensure that everything was
                collected on time and that everything was submitted. Because of this, it was a little stressful
                especially due to the other things I had to pay attention to, including school and family plans at the
                time. In the end, I managed it.

                <br><br>I was glad to see that everything ran smoothly during the actual event and that we were able to
                stay on
                track and deal with sudden obstacles effectively, such as accommodating last-minute requests from
                participants. However, staying organized helped immensely and with collaboration from everyone involved
                (such as other volunteers, participants, and organizers), the event went swimmingly. Each team had a
                wonderful time competing against one another and overall, the event was a great success.

                <br><br>Because of this activity, I am more aware of the details involved in such events as these and am
                able to
                deal with them more efficiently.

                <i>Role: Assistant Organizer (Committee Head)</i>

                <br><br>The Bacong Junior Basketball Tournament Championship was held in Bacong Gymnasium starting at
                5:30 PM on October 22,
                2024, with many teams of young individuals in attendance competing for the championship at the event.
                The event was organized by the Municipality of Bacong officials, and being a citizen of Bacong I was
                given the opportunity to be an organizer of the programs committee at this event, which was a
                challenging yet fulfilling experience, especially due to the fact that it was such a busy week in my
                life.

                <br><br>The role of program coordinator required a bit of brainstorming on my part, as well as major cooperation
                between myself and the other people involved in shaping the event. I had to juggle a lot of different
                responsibilities, such as ensuring the program scheduling was satisfactory, making sure that the other
                branches of committees/individuals that were critical to the success of the program were informed and
                updated, and that the event itself was to run smoothly. It was a lot more difficult than I had expected,
                though now I realize that from the get-go, it was not going to be an easy task.

                <br><br>The hardest part for me was communicating and getting in touch with the necessary people, such as
                coaches and referees for the event. Everyone had to know their responsibilities, a priority that fell on
                the shoulders of the program coordinators. Although, in this sense, I feel that my skills towards
                management and coordination as well as consistent communication have been improved thanks to this event,
                considering that the flow of things went smoothly once everything was set in place. Seeing the
                satisfaction of my fellow volunteers and the eventual success of the game brought me a lot of
                fulfillment in the end.

                <br><br>Because of this activity, I am a more team-oriented and communicative person, and I know the true value
                of strategic thinking.

                <i>Role: Participant</i>
                <br><br>The FPBC Basketball Tournament was held in Daro Gym on the morning hours of December 8, 2024, specifically from 8:00 AM-12:00 PM. The tournament was held between multiple teams who competed until they won the championship. Many students from CCS were in attendance, and I joined this event as a part of the working committee, bringing food for the contestants and attendees to snack on while also taking pictures of the game.

                <br><br>I expected this event to be rather short, but it actually took up most of the morning, which I found fun since the games were invigorating and everyone was enjoying themselves. However, I had to focus more on my job than on the game itself since I was multitasking between handing out the food and taking pictures of the game, while simultaneously also trying to watch the game. At some point, it even began raining, which impeded everyone’s mobility and hearing due to how loud and strong it was, but it was manageable due to the sturdy roof of the gymnasium.
                
                <br><br>Watching the players compete against each other made me realize that a lot of training and hard work must be done in order to be good at a sport. There was a lot of skill involved in the players’ movements, which must have been learned over time. In addition, I realized the value of truly good sportsmanship. Coordination and teamwork between team members is eventually what scored the winning team the championship.
                
                <br><br>Because of this activity, I am motivated to pursue the things I want to do, even if it requires a lot of skill, practice, and coordination.

                <i>Role: Working Committee</i>
                <br><br>The CodeQuest competition was held at Silliman University College of Computer Studies from 1:00 to 3:00 PM, specifically in CC 5 during the CCS Founder’s Week activities. The event focused around sets of problems that teams of 3 would have to solve together. I worked as a Technicals committee member during this event, being the only one there. I was joined by fellow students and other people from the other committees, such as the committee heads and the attendance committee.

                <br><br>I was tasked to set up the technical aspects of the event, which meant ensuring all the computers were functioning properly and that the programs to be used on the computers weren’t bugging out. I also had to ensure that everyone was seated on the right desktops. I expected the event to be more stressful, but as one of my first jobs in a committee, it honestly wasn’t too bad. After the initial influx of competitors entering the event, the rest of the event played out without any hiccups, other than some of the competition’s questions being too hard for anyone to figure out.
                
                <br><br>I believe that this event was a nice and slow paced way for me to adjust myself to the environment of being in a working committee. It was one of my first jobs of the entire semester, but was not stressful as it was a low-pressure environment with not too many people present, other than the competitors themselves. I learned how the computers in the lab worked and how to work them. I met a few new friends there while I was watching over the competition, which wouldn’t have happened had it not been for my desire to attend.
                
                <br><br>Because of this activity, I am more accustomed to being around my college mates and I am more comfortable working with the equipment that I will soon be utilizing extensively in my field.
