        <p class="category">Christian faith is foundational to Silliman education. Various activities for faith nurture, education, worship, fellowship, and service are in store for Silliman students all year round. These are activities that are receptive to the changing needs and preferences of students. Church activities are designed and organized in a way that does not discriminate students from other religious denominations.</p>

                <i>Role: Participant</i>

                <br><br>The CCS Opening Devotion was held on August 19, 2024 from 7:30-9:00 AM, organized by the SU Church to open the week for Silliman’s College of Computer Studies. As a Computer Science student, I along with the rest of my department were encouraged to take part in and spectate this event. The event gathered all the students in the college for a moment of worship as a community and brought us together both physically and spiritually.

                <br><br>The dean of our college, Asst. Prof. Joy Dy performed the opening remarks and greetings for the mass, after which we all participated in various worship songs. The message of the service was that all things are done through the power of God, who can do all things, but although His power is immense, He will not always help us in what we ask for or give us what we want. However, in the end, it is crucial to remember that He always does what is best for us in the long run. The scripture reading was from Ephesians 3:20-21, delivered by Rev. Iris H. Tibus. The whole college being there was a pleasant surprise and a great experience, as I felt closer with everyone there during the service as we all worshiped in unison.
                
                <br><br>After the service, I realized the value in persevering even when it seems like nothing is going right, and I realized that faith plays a powerful role in doing that. I gained a new perspective on my studies, as the lessons I learned during the mass very much applied to them. I hope to one day utilize these life lessons in my future endeavors. I will continue to do my best and have faith in God throughout my studies.
                
                <br><br>Because of this activity, I am of the belief that I can excel in my studies and throughout my life just as long as I remember to have faith and to remember my values.

                <i>Role: Working Committee</i>

                <br><br>On October 27, 2024 from 9:30 to 12:00, the Kids for Christ Movement held their Monthly Bible Kids School at Ajong Gymnasium, the event taking place as a way for children to get involved with the word of God and to hear the teachings of the Bible. I was a volunteer facilitator at the event, helping out with the session itself, interacting with, and teaching the children.

                <br><br>As a facilitator, I was responsible for familiarizing myself with the happenings of the event and ensuring they went through. The expectations I had were quite in line with what happened at the event. Upon everyone’s arrival, a prayer was held, after which we all got the children acquainted with one another through group activities such as singing songs of worship, and playing small games. I was happy to assist in these activities, especially the games, during which I saw the children having fun and getting along in the name of our God.
                
                <br><br>This experience made me realize the importance of valuing God at an early age and how communities should work to involve children in worship, as it builds their character. Children unfortunately tend to think that acts of worship and spirituality are boring, but when involved in an age-appropriate environment, they do begin to enjoy themselves and see the light in such activities. It was inspiring to see, and I was happy to be a part of this event despite how busy I was in the midst of it.
                
                <br><br>Because of this activity, I am aware of the importance of involving the youth in spiritual activities and I see that it can be made fun for them.

                <i>Role: Participant</i>
                <br><br>The Midweek Convocation was held on November 20, 2024 at SU Church from 6:30 PM onwards to commemorate the celebration of the UCLEM, with many people from all college departments including students, faculty, and staff in attendance. This was the 2nd midweek convocation, spanning students from CBA, Agriculture, CMC, Coe, CCS, and the school’s graduate program.

                <br><br>The theme for this year’s UCLEM was Faith over Fear: Facing Life’s Giants, which was made evident by the convocation’s speakers through their stories of faith and readings. The story of David and Goliath was retold to us, and we were to ask ourselves about the giants in our lives. The main speaker of the convocation recalled when the pandemic was at its peak, and he experienced a life-threatening bout of COVID and had to be sent to the emergency room. This made an impact on me, as someone who fears death. The speaker described how his faith in God led him to accept whatever came next without fear, and in the end, everything turned out to be alright.
                
                <br><br>This experience has affected my worldview in that it made me think about how easily our minds are impacted by fear. Although the reaction is necessary for our survival, faith can assist us even in the darkest of times. Remembering this is essential for keeping your head afloat, because sinking too far down into a spiral is more often than not detrimental. Realizing this, I questioned the giants in my life and how to overcome them.
                
                <br><br>Because of this activity, I am more aware of what troubles me, and I am sure that I can defeat them.

            <p class="entrytext"><i>Role: Participant</i>
                <br><br>The Galilean Fellowship was held on two days (November 19 and 21), but my section was to
                attend the fellowship on only the first day at around 6:00 PM (the organizers were a bit late). It was held in the CAS building,
                Ausejo Hall, and was done by section, so I was with my CHS classmates during the event. The event
                was based around the UCLEM theme of Facing Life's Giants, which we were informed of by the speakers
                from Divinity School.

                <br><br>The fellowship started later than expected, but when it did start, it caught my attention immediately.
                The hosts asked us to come upstage one by one, introduce ourselves and our greatest fear, and place our
                hand in a mysterious box. As everyone did so, reactions varied, but when I reached into the box, there
                turned out to be nothing inside of it. To me, this was the perfect example of their message that things
                do not have to be scary as long as you have trust that everything will turn out fine. As the event went
                on, we were encouraged to participate in multiple worship songs, and the highlight of the event to me
                was when we were asked to do a live reenactment of the story of David and Goliath.

                <br><br>This event made me think about the concept of fear, and how fear itself can hurt us even when nothing else is.
                Even if everything is safe, our fear can tip us over into making us think our surroundings are unsafe.
                This is what made me realize that faith is truly important in facing the obstacles in our lives. No matter
                how difficult, if we have more faith than we do fear, we will struggle. I implanted this statement in my mind.
                I am a believer that resilience is the most important value to have.

                <br><br>Because of this event, I am reminded that although fear is an obstacle, it is never impossible to beat.

            <p class="entrytext"><i>Role: Participant</i>
                <br><br>The Thanksgiving Fellowship was held on November 27, 2024 at 9:00 AM, with special guest speaker
                Dennis McCann, husband of Silliman University’s president, Dr. Betty Cernol-McCann. The event was held in
                celebration of American thanksgiving, which was around the date the event was held. The event was
                organized by the OSF in collaboration with Silliman University’s American Corner, and took place
                in the Luce Auditorium lobby.

                <br><br>At the event, Mr. McCann spoke about his experience with celebrating Thanksgiving back when he was still
                living in the United States. He shared his stories throughout the years, and throughout his speech, reminded
                us of the importance of being together with one's family to give thanks for everything that God has given us.
                Although some in attendance were Filipinos, and many attendees came from different parts of the world, we
                were all united by his message to celebrate in unity and in thanks of what the Lord has given us. At the height
                of the event, we played games related to the act of thanksgiving, and talked about what we were grateful for.

                <br><br>Upon the end of the event, I reflected on my attitude towards the things I have in my life, and I realized
                just how much there is to be grateful for. All things in this world, we have God to thank for, and I realized
                the act of giving thanks in unity is one of the best ways to express this gratitude. My mindset has changed
                for the future, and I plan to offer more of my time in such activities.

                <br><br>Because of this activity, I am more aware of the blessings I've been given and am more grateful for them.

                <br><br>The UCLEM Worship Culmination and Christmas Tree Lighting was held on November 27, 2024 at 6:00 PM and ended at 8:00 PM, fittingly towards the end of the month. The event was meant to celebrate the end (the culmination) of the UCLEM, as well as to bring in the month of December by lighting the grand Christmas tree in the campus. Many people were in attendance at this event, including my school mates and even a live band.

                <br><br>The main speaker of this event was Sir Mark Angelo Cadungog, who gave an inspiring speech on overcoming your obstacles and never giving up in the face of adversity. His message and personal story of overcoming poverty and hardship through faith in God and resilience was a reminder to everyone in the audience, including myself, that all things are possible if you just have faith.
                
                <br><br>I realized that if you feel like you have nothing else, there will always be faith that you can count on. Relying on God to guide you through your life, in times of both good and bad, can help you immensely as He is the one who can ease your sorrows and bring joy to the world. It is an important mindset to keep in mind for now and for the future.

            <p class="entrytext"><i>Role: Participant</i>
                <br><br>I unfortunately do not attend Sunday mass often, but I managed to go to mass at St. Catherine of Alexandria Church at 11:00 AM, also known as the Cathedral church one Sunday on November 24, 2024. Attending mass is a long-honored tradition amongst Christians, so although I knew what to expect going in, the experience was still valuable to me.

                <br><br>The act of going into mass with a community of people with a shared purpose and faith in God is a rare occurrence for me nowadays due to how busy I am. However, it has not lost its specialness. During the mass, I expressed my faith and gratitude towards God by participating in the readings of the day and the prayers held. I felt engaged just listening to the homily of the priest and hearing the words of God which, on that particular Sunday, focused on encouraging peace and cooperation towards one another.
                
                <br><br>This experience enhanced my view on the world by reminding me that going to church every week, albeit difficult with a tight schedule, is still an important part of one’s life to prioritize. Going to church provides you with the comfort of knowing that God is there for you and knowing that others are praying with you and for you adds to a sense of safety and community.
                
                <br><br>Because of this activity, I am more spiritually inclined and have remembered the importance of spirituality in my daily life.
