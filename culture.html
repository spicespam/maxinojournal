        <p class="category"> Every semester, the Cultural Affairs Committee stages five shows that put value on the appreciation for the arts at what most consider as the “cultural center of the south”: the Claire Isabel McGill Luce Auditorium. Silliman students get a taste of the works of nationally- and internationally-acclaimed literary, visual and performing artists throughout the school year. Season tickets at subsidized rates are made available to students.</p>

            <p class="entrytext"><i>Role: Participant</i>
                <br><br>The Freshie Walk was an event that occured in the SU Campus from 12:45-5:00 PM that gave freshmen a chance to walk with peers around
                Silliman University’s campus. It started near the gym and ended at the amphitheatre, with each college’s
                student body following one after another, with various activities being hosted at the amphitheatre as
                everyone mingled. Being a freshman, I attended this event as a participant with the rest of my
                classmates.

                <br><br>I had honestly expected the event to be a lot shorter than it was, perhaps lasting an hour or
                two at
                most, but it lasted for the whole afternoon. It was not bad at all, though, as it gave me the
                opportunity to
                reconnect with friends, of which many I had not seen in months due to the summer break. I was happy to
                see
                all the different cheers and performances from each college, and even participated in my own college’s
                cheer. I liked the time I got to spend with my friends, new and old.

                <br><br>This activity allowed me to get comfortable with my new social environment as I was able to
                scope
                out the types of people present in each department, including my own. It was tiring at times, but it
                also
                taught me that fun can still be had even during times of mild exhaustion.

                <br><br>Because of this activity, I have more courage in going out and meeting new people, and I am more
                comfortable in my environment.

                <i>Role: Working Committee</i>
                <br><br>The CCS Movie Nights were a series of events held during the late hours of CCS week (August 21-23, 2024, from 5:00-7:00 PM)
                at
                the beginning of the school year’s first semester. As a working member of the tech committee, my
                co-members,
                committee head, and myself helped in setting up the venue (the ATA hall) to ensure that the night went
                smoothly.

                <br><br>Initially, I had expected the setup of the event to go smoothly, but there were quite a few
                technical issues
                that caused some difficulties, such as the extension cord for the projector being in use somewhere else.
                The
                head of our committee was able to solve the problem, however we had to think of alternative solutions
                and
                plans just in case. Other than that, after the initial setup, the night went nicely and we were able to
                watch the movies without any hiccups. It was satisfying to relax with the rest of the crowd after our
                brief
                moments of panic.

                <br><br>I believe I benefited from this activity since it provided me with some experience with how the
                equipment in
                the classrooms works behind the scenes and gave me some insight on how it is to work in a committee,
                since
                this was my first time properly ever being part of one. I also got to work with people who I had never
                spoken to before, which eventually pushed me to figure out how to navigate socially. All in all, if I
                had to
                redo this activity, I would definitely try to relax a little more.

                <br><br>Because of this activity, I am more confident in my skills as a person in my field.

                <br><br>The Guidance and Counseling Group Dynamics Activity was an event held at ATA Hall on
                August
                19-21, 2024 from 10:00 AM-12:00 PM as a way for new students to get acquainted with the counseling system as well as with each
                other. During this event, all students were briefed on how the guidance counseling process works, after
                which we all got to play icebreaker games with each other. I joined this event as a participant.

                <br><br>My expectations of this event were definitely a lot more impersonal and quicker than the event
                actually was.
                I expected a simple talk, but I was pleasantly surprised when we were actually encouraged to interact
                with
                one another. I was happy to see everyone get along with each other despite no one really knowing each
                other.
                I joined all the games, one of which being a group game requiring us to hold on to one another while
                running, and it was a lot of fun since things got physically rowdy very quickly.

                <br><br>I would say this event encouraged me to get out of my comfort zone and look out of my shell a
                lot
                more. I
                made quite a few friends by the end of the activities, and even if I may not have talked to everyone, I
                understood the general gist of my social environment and found it rather inviting and comforting. It
                shifted
                my worldview of my college department, and I felt less ashamed of myself.

                <br><br>Because of this activity, I am comfortable having fun around my peers.

                <br><br>The Fitness Challenge was a multiple-day event that encouraged students to dance and
                enjoy
                the morning with each other with the help of visual and music accompaniment. I attended this event on
                August
                20, 2024 from 7:30-8:30 AM. I was joined by some of my classmates.

                <br><br>My expectations for this event were fully met. There was a screen in front of all of us in the
                ATA
                Hall
                playing various Zumba and Just Dance videos, and we all followed them. It got tiring after a while, and
                I
                felt like tapping out after the 3rd or 4th song, but everyone else’s presence did help me slightly.

                <br><br>The activity felt very similar to the ones I would participate in elementary and high school,
                except
                I did not know most of the people in the room. Still, it evoked a sense of excitement and I felt
                carefree. Even if
                I was tired, I continued participating until the very end of the event. I also met some new people who I
                sticked with because of our shared experience at the event.

                <br><br>Because of this activity, I am more involved in the social lives of my classmates.

            <p class="entrytext"><i>Role: Participant</i>
                <br><br>The Parada Sillimaniana is an annual event held during Silliman University’s founders
                week, and on August 26, 2024 starting from 1:00 PM, I was given the opportunity to participate in it along with my fellow
                classmates. Students like me were encouraged to participate in the event by walking in the parade with
                the rest of the college, and so I joined at the last minute.

                <br><br>My expectations of this event were met rather accurately. I expected it to be physically
                exhausting, but
                still fun. In truth, I had expected it to be more tiring than it actually was. Thankfully the weather
                that day seemed to be forgiving. When we had reached our destination, the Cimafranca ball field, we were
                made to watch the different college departments participate in a dance performance, which I personally
                believe was the highlight of the event.

                <br><br>This event was a new experience for me, as I have always been the one watching parades rather
                than
                participating in them. Although all we did was walk, it was nice to see all the people watching from the
                sidewalk and having small interactions with the passersby. The sense of camaraderie I shared with my
                classmates while we all walked around the city was fun, too.

                <br><br>Because of this activity, I am more confident in my ability to withstand new experiences.

            <p class="entrytext"><i>Role: Participant</i>
                <br><br>The Council IPR was an event held at Millennial’s Place, Junob, which was organized for
                members of the Confederates Student Council to all get together and learn more about each other as a
                team. As a member of the Technicals committee, I was joined by some fellow members of my committee as
                well as my committee head, as well as all the other committees. The event lasted the whole day, from 10:00 AM
                to 6:00 PM, with
                multiple activities to keep us busy.

                <br><br>In all honesty, I had expected the activity to be low-stress and low-energy, but what I
                experienced was
                the exact opposite. After eating lunch and finishing the initial introduction of all the committees,
                guidance counselors came in and collected us all in groups to play games together. Since we were all
                shuffled, none of us really knew each other, which forced us to get along with people we did not know.
                The activities were also rather physically taxing, which instilled in us a sense of togetherness amidst
                our exhaustion. A game that I consider simultaneously my least and most favorite is one where we all had
                to link arms and run all over the place to locate hidden flags in the area. It was extremely tiring, but
                the difficulty of the activities pushed us to work together.

                <br><br>I had never been involved in any sort of working committee nor have I ever been remotely
                involved in
                council activities, so this activity was the first time I had ever been exposed to the truths of
                anything of this nature. Admittedly, I thought the environment would be much more professional and
                strict, but that couldn’t be further from the truth. I felt like by the end of the event, I was at least
                good acquaintances with everyone present, even though I had only met most of them on that very day.

                <br><br>Because of this activity, I am more comfortable being around new people and I have more
                confidence in my
                teamwork abilities.

            <p class="entrytext"><i>Role: Participant</i>
                <br><br>The Kuwerdas concert at Luce Auditorium was held on September 14, 2024 at 2:00 PM, as a major
                component of DIWANG: Musika ng Rondalla, Musika ng Nagkakaisa. Bearing a season pass for the 62nd
                Cultural Season shows, I had the opportunity to sit in the front row at this event. While watching the
                show, I was joined by fellow students, both from Silliman and from other schools.

                <br><br>The show was life-changing. Through it, I was introduced to many iconic cultural pieces through
                beautiful renditions of each song, including one that ended up as #1 on my Spotify Wrapped thanks to
                this concert. Surprisingly, my piano teacher was also a part of the performance playing one of the
                rondallas. I honestly initially expected the show to be rather boring, sort of like background music
                without much excitement in the air. I couldn’t have been more wrong. Whereas before this event, I would
                shrug at the notion of going to shows or plays, now I am excited for each and every one of them. I
                remember my shock when the opera singer came out to sing a few songs, as she was literally right in
                front of me.

                <br><br>This experience, as I have previously stated, has shifted the way I feel about live performances. I have
                always been passionate about art, but I have mostly ignored the theatre arts until now. I realized that
                the act of watching a performance in person, rather than in front of a screen, is so much different than
                one would expect. The appreciation is heightened significantly, since you can feel it in the atmosphere.

                <br><br>Because of this activity, I am a more inspired person and I am able to appreciate arts and culture
                deeper than ever before.
